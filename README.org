* Agda Snippets

This library provides a very simple function that translates just the code blocks
of a literate Agda file to colourised, hyperlinked HTML. The output of this
can then be run through Pandoc or other document processors to allow literate 
Agda to be comfortably written in any format that allows inline HTML snippets.

There is also a simple command-line application (~agda-snippets~) included 
that can be used as a standalone file processor.

The location of library source hyperlinks is configurable, as is the CSS class
given to Agda code blocks.

This package is pinned to particular Agda versions, and therefore does not 
obey the PVP, as Agda does not. You should use whichever version of this library
corresponds to the Agda version you wish to use.
